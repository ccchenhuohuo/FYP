  - id: ADMIN_FRONTEND_SEPARATION
    message: "Admin front-end code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) should be separated into distinct files."
    advice: |
      Keep admin templates (`templates/admin/*.html`) focused on structure.
      Move all page-specific styles to corresponding CSS files in `static/css/` (e.g., `admin_users.css`).
      Move all page-specific JavaScript to corresponding JS files in `static/js/` (e.g., `admin_users.js`).
      Use Jinja blocks (`{% block styles %}` and `{% block scripts %}`) to link external assets.
      Layout-specific styles (`admin_layout.css`) and scripts (`admin_layout.js`) are acceptable.

  - id: LANGUAGE_REQUIREMENTS
    message: "Code comments must be in Chinese. All user-facing text on web pages must be in English."
    advice: |
     Use Chinese for all code comments (`# ...`, `/* ... */`, `<!-- ... -->`). Ensure all text visible to the end-user in HTML templates (e.g., labels, button text, titles, messages) is in English.
